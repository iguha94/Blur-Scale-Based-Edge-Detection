# A Model-Independent Method for Local Blur Estimation and its Application to Edge Detection

Qualitative comparison of edge detection results, from few real world images, obtained using a novel blur-scale based method and two other state-of-the-art algorithms. Each Frame shows a grayscale image, edge detection results from the same image using Canny's algorithm, Elder and Zucker's original method , revised Elder and Zucker's algorithm implemented in matlab, and the proposed blur-scale based algorithm in the same order.
